# AVL
Full Implementation of a Balanced Binary Search Tree (AVL)

# Description
The AVL<E> class is an implementation of a self-balancing binary search tree. This implementation provides guaranteed O(H) (H is the height of this tree which is as low as logN and is the time cost for the basic operations (add, remove and contains). This class implements many of the methods provided by the Java framework's TreeSet class. Some parts and concepts of this code were understood and adapted from popular websites like GeeksForGeeks, StackOverflow and other websites.
